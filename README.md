# Manage File Paths

A blender add-on thrown together in a hurry that's supposed to help manage... file paths... yep.

In very early stages still, just has some basic functionality.

Supports images and caches.

## Installation

[Download the .py file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregzaal/manage-file-paths/master/manage_file_paths.py) (right click > Save As) and install it in your Blender preferences.
